# APLASE
Compression algorithms

APLA: Adaptive Piecewise Algorithm
SE: Sparse Encoding 
APLASE: Applying SE on reconstruction error generated by APLA

The folders contain the error and compression plots generated by APLA, SE, and APLASE. They show the distribution of error and compression using box plots for multiple settings of atom length of the used dictionary and number of atoms used for Sparse encoding.
These algorithms were run on 116 sensors across 400 flights. The folder "Without_outlier" contains plots by not plotting the outliers.

In all the plot, on the x-axis, the following is the convention of the naming scheme

'PLA': APLA only
Tx l=y: T means APLASE algorithm, x is the number of atoms of the dictionary used, and y is the atom length of the dictionary used.
Dx l=y: T means SE algorithm, x is the number of atoms of the dictionary used, and y is the atom length of the dictionary used.

The lossless plots show only for APLASE.
